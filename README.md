About this project:
This project is a commerce site. It is a full stack project. The front end is react, the back end is node.js, the database is mongodb. I don't finish the payment part and profile functionalities yet. I will finish them in a few days. I don't use redux in this project. I use context to manage the state of the project. One day I will use redux to modify this or create another project.
